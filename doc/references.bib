   abstract    = {Programming languages are not only useful to command
                 computers, they also increasingly are a medium for human
                 communication. I will use the framework of distributed
                 cognition to discuss how knowledge is shared in a team of
                 programmers and to show that computer code plays an
                 important role in it. The resulting model of how
                 programmers comprehend code suggests that common grounds
                 play an important role in it. I propose two hypotheses
                 concerning the means used by programmers to refer to
                 common grounds from within their code. The hypotheses
                 imply that modern languages, such as Scala, offer
                 advantages as human communication mediums. I describe an
                 experiment, using an eye-tracking device, that measures
                 the performance of code comprehension. The hypotheses are
                 tested by varying the degree of reference to common
                 grounds.},
